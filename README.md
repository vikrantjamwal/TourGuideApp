### Project Overview
In this project the goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting our city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. 

### Why this project?
In this project we learn how to present information in a multi-screen app to our users.

### What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:

* Planning your app design and navigation before coding.
* Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
* Building layouts to display those lists of data.
* Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
* Creating your own custom classes.
* Properly handling images or audio (if applicable).
